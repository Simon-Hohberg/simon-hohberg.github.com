# Traffic evaluation of a claim-based single sign-on system with focus on mobile devices

The work on Web services security is not that new; however, the provided solutions either are not efficient, or applicable only to some special cases. As an example, the standardization group OASIS specified a huge amount of standards, which are unofficially called WS-*. Unfortunately, not all of these standards are implemented by modern frameworks and their applicability to mobile Web services is also questionable. As the WS-* technologies are very useful in realizing single sign on (SSO) solutions, we discuss, in this paper, an implementation prototype for a single sign-on system with WS-* standards and evaluate the resulting network traffic while focusing on mobile devices.
