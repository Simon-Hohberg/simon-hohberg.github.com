# Interactive Key Frame Motion Editor for Humanoid Robots

Static motions enable humanoid robots to solve static problems where a dynamic
solution would not provide noteworthy benefits. The most popular technique to
create static motions for humanoid robots is keyframing. Since a key frame motion
defines many joint angles, tools for the design of key frame motions should support
the motion designer to deal with them.
