# Wildfire Smoke Detection using Convolutional Neural Networks

I investigated if CNNs can be applied to the problem of wildfire smoke detection. Besides CNNs that use spatial 
features only, C3D networks that can also extract temporal features are considered. To tackle the detection of smoke in a larger image, a selective search variant was developed, that preselects regions of observable motion, which are 
then classified by the actual models.
